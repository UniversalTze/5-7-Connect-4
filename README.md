# 5-7 Connect 4 Web Prototype

## Description
This web app is a fresh take on the classic Connect 4 game. Two players compete to score points by forming combos of four or more pieces in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—within a set time. Unique mechanics like disappearing rows and a rotating board add an exciting twist to the traditional gameplay. 

### Features
- Two-player game with a timed piece placement.
- Points are scored by connecting four or more pieces in a row.
- The game ends when time runs out, and the player with the highest score wins.
- Scored rows disappear, and pieces above fall.
- The board randomly rotates at intervals, shifting pieces and creating new opportunities.

## Purpose of the Prototype
This prototype helps us test and fine-tune game mechanics and visuals before transitioning to hardware with Arduino. It allows us to:
- Refine gameplay.
- Structure the program logic for easier hardware integration.
- Make quick adjustments during development.

## Why Connect 4?
We chose Connect 4 for its strong values:
- Board games foster communication, collaboration, and a sense of community.
- They offer fun and challenge, helping players build problem-solving skills and empathy.
- Our twist on the game—adding rotating boards and disappearing rows—creates a dynamic, fun experience that balances strategy and skill.
- By integrating with hardware, we aim to make the game more engaging and visually immersive.
